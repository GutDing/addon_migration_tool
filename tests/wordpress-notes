TODO
Add posts and comments
Check all inserted values and have proper defaults for each of them
Check if we need to process metas for pages and posts
Ask Andrew how to deal with special blocks inside content blocks
Ask Andrew - Tree structure not kept when moving pages
Maybe I do not need to rename the CIFImporter and the CIFBlockImporter....that's why we have namespaces...

TODO AFTER
Add Users

Pages to import
- 3 types of post_type: page, post, attachment. In this case, attachments are images to a post that has a gallery
- Attachments (images) can be accessed via its own page. Should we respect that?
- Gallery items also can speify which posts (images) to include. There is also an example of a gallery that
shows the images in randomised order.
